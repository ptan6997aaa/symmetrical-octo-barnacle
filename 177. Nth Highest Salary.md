177. Nth Highest Salary
Table: Employee

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| salary      | int  |
+-------------+------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the salary of an employee.
 

Write a solution to find the nth highest distinct salary from the Employee table. If there are less than n distinct salaries, return null.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
n = 2
Output: 
+------------------------+
| getNthHighestSalary(2) |
+------------------------+
| 200                    |
+------------------------+
Example 2:

Input: 
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
+----+--------+
n = 2
Output: 
+------------------------+
| getNthHighestSalary(2) |
+------------------------+
| null                   |
+------------------------+
```

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
    RETURN (
      # Write your MySQL query statement below.
        WITH dedup_table AS (
            SELECT DISTINCT salary 
            FROM Employee 
        ),
        rank_table AS (
           SELECT 
            salary, 
            DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rnk  
            FROM dedup_table 
        )
        SELECT salary 
        FROM rank_table 
        WHERE rnk = N  
  );
END
```
